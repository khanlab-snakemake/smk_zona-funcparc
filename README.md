[![Snakemake](https://img.shields.io/badge/snakemake-â‰¥3.12.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://snakemake.bitbucket.io)

This is a Snakemake workflow for performing functional connectivity-based segmentation of the zona-incerta. It is developed to work with pre-processed HCP 3T and 7T data. Follows the same workflow as the original [Diffusion-based Parcellation] (https://github.com/akhanf/zona-diffparc) scheme.
